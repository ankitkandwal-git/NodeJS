# Introduction to Node.js Project

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser, making it possible to build scalable server-side and networking applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications.

## Modules and Packages Used

### 1. Express
- A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Used to build web applications and APIs.

### 2. Nodemon
- A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server.
- Useful for development to speed up the workflow.

### 3. Dotenv
- Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- Helps manage configuration and secrets securely.

## ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) Features
This project uses modern JavaScript (ES6) features such as:
- `const` and `let` for variable declarations
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring assignment
- Modules (with `require` and `import` if enabled)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm run start` or `nodemon index.js`

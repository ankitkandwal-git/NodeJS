  "description": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser, making it possible to build scalable server-side and networking applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications.",
